        <p>This pizza dough recipe was given to me by a friend. It's quick and easy to make for a delicious homemade pizza crust that you can top with pizza sauce and your favorite toppings!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 cups bread flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine bread flour, olive oil, sugar, salt, and yeast mixture in a mixing bowl; stir well to combine. Beat until a stiff dough has formed. Cover the bowl; let rise at room temperature until dough doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a well-floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a thin crust. Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, about 20 minutes</li>
        </ol>
